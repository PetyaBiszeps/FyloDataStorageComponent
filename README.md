### What-I-Learned

Funny thing I didn't expect this challenge to not having responsive input. I tried to make it and I actually did it,
but without gradient and it made me surrender this idea of responsive slider... Except that, this challenge is not really hard,
just need to have some basic knowledge and you're good to go for this practice mission!
